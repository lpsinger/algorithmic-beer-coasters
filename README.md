# Algorithmic Beer Coasters

This is a collection of Python scripts that generate a variety of fractal
designs for beverage coasters. Each design is based on a different
[space-filling curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-filling_curve),
evaluated using a [Lindenmayer system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system).

These scripts have only two dependencies:
[Shapely](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Shapely) and
[Numpy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpy).
